So here I am...  
Trying to learn to use words, and every attempt  
Is a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure  
Because one has only learnt to get the better of words  
For the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which   
One is no longer disposed to say it.  
  
From "East Coker" by T. S. Eliot
